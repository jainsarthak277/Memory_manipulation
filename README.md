# Principles-of-Embedded-Software
Contains all code files for the course of Principles of Embedded Software,
under the guidance of Prof. Kevin Gross. The course focuses on the basics concepts of embedded systems,
like writing our own Makefiles, memory allocation and management in a development board, use of circular 
buffers to write our own UART drivers, and the use of DMA to write to memory without the use of a processor.
